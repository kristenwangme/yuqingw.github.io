Chemotherapy uses different drugs to kill or slow the growth of cancer cells; immunotherapy uses treatments to stimulate or restore the ability of the immune system to fight cancer.", "Chemoimmunotherapy is when doctors use two types of medicine together to treat cancer. One type of medicine is chemotherapy, which kills or slows down the growth of cancer cells. The other type of medicine is immunotherapy, which helps the body's own immune system fight against cancer. By using both of these medicines together, doctors hope to give the body a stronger chance of beating cancer."],
    ["Risk factor", "Risk factor is Something that increases the chance of developing a disease. Some examples of risk factors for cancer are age, a family history of certain cancers, use of tobacco products, being exposed to radiation or certain chemicals, infection with certain viruses or bacteria, and certain genetic changes.", "Risk factors are things that make it more likely for someone to get a particular disease. For example, if you have a family history of heart disease, that makes you more likely to get heart disease too. Similarly, smoking can increase your risk of getting lung cancer. Knowing about these risk factors can help doctors and patients take steps to reduce the chance of getting sick."],

Radiation may come from a machine outside the body (external-beam radiation therapy), or it may come from radioactive material placed in the body near cancer cells (internal radiation therapy or brachytherapy). Systemic radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance, such as a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody, that travels in the blood to tissues throughout the body. Also called irradiation and radiotherapy.", "Radiation therapy is when doctors use special machines or tiny amounts of radioactive material inside your body to kill cancer cells. It helps shrink tumors and make them smaller so they're easier to remove. This can happen from the outside of your body (like getting an X-ray) or inside your body (like a small amount of radioactive stuff inside a vein). Either way, it's like giving your body a special kind of treatment to help fight cancer."],

A radiation-measuring device detects the radioactive octreotide, and makes pictures showing where the tumor cells are in the body. Also called octreotide scan and SRS.", "Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy is a test doctors use to find certain kinds of tumors in your body. They give you a special medicine called octreotide that acts like a key and locks onto places in your body where there are tumors that have special receptors on them. A machine then takes pictures of these places and shows where the tumors are located. It's kind of like a treasure hunt for doctors to find the tumors!"],
    ["Stereotactic body radiation therapy", "Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses special equipment to position a patient and precisely deliver radiation to tumors in the body (except the brain).

Also called SABR, SBRT, and stereotactic ablative body radiation therapy.", "Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a way for doctors to give cancer treatment using special machines that can target tiny areas in your body with a lot of precision. Instead of getting one big dose of radiation all at once, you get many small doses spread out over several days. This helps protect other healthy parts of your body from getting hurt."],
    ["Karyotyping", "Karyotyping is a type of genetic test that analyzes the size, shape, and number of chromosomes in a sample of cells taken from blood, amniotic fluid, bone marrow, or other tissue. Changes in the number or structure of chromosomes may be a sign of a birth defect or genetic disease or condition, such as Down syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, or Turner syndrome. Karyotyping may also be used to help diagnose certain types of cancer, such as leukemia, lymphoma, or myeloma, and/or help plan treatment.", "Karyotyping is a test that helps doctors look at the structure of our DNA inside our cells. They take a small sample of blood or another kind of cell and use special tools to see how many chromosomes there are and what they look like. If there are changes in the number or shape of the chromosomes, it could be a sign of a genetic problem or disease. This test can help doctors figure out if someone has a condition like Down syndrome or cancer, and it can also help them plan the best treatment."],

It's like a map that shows where the cancer is located and how far it has spread. Doctors use staging to figure out the best treatment plan for each patient."],
    ["Endocrine therapy", "Endocrine therapy is treatment that adds, blocks, or removes hormones. For certain conditions (such as diabetes or menopause), hormones are given to adjust low hormone levels. Hormones can also cause certain cancers (such as prostate and breast cancer) to grow. To slow or stop the growth of cancer, synthetic hormones or other drugs may be given to block the body’s natural hormones, or surgery is used to remove the gland that makes a certain hormone. Also called hormonal therapy, hormone therapy, and hormone treatment.", "Endocrine therapy is when doctors use hormones to help treat certain medical problems. They might add some hormones to make up for ones that are too low, like in cases of diabetes. Or they might take away some hormones to slow down or stop cancer cells from growing, like in cases of breast or prostate cancer. This type of treatment is called endocrine therapy because it affects the glands that make hormones in the body."],
    ["Recurrence", "Recurrence is cancer that has recurred (come back), usually after a period of time during which the cancer could not be detected. The cancer may come back to the same place as the original (primary) tumor or to another place in the body. Also called recurrent cancer.", "Recurrence means when cancer comes back after it was treated and couldn't be found for a while. It can come back to the same spot as the original tumor or somewhere else in the body. It's like a bad guy that keeps coming back, even after you thought you defeated it."],

The tumor releases chemicals into your body that can cause flushing, redness on your skin, stomach problems, breathing issues, and changes in your heart rate. These changes can happen suddenly and can be really uncomfortable."],
    ["TIL therapy", "TIL therapy is a type of treatment in which tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill cancer cells) are removed from a patient’s tumor and grown in large numbers in a laboratory. These lymphocytes are then given back to the patient by infusion to help the immune system kill the cancer cells. Also called tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte therapy.", "TIL therapy is a way to treat cancer by using the body's own immune system to fight the disease. Doctors take some of the immune cells that are inside the tumor, grow them in a lab, and then give them back to the patient to help their body attack the cancer cells.

Also called adrenocortical cancer and cancer of the adrenal cortex.", "Adrenocortical carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the outer layer of the adrenal gland, which is a small organ on top of each kidney. This cancer can affect how the adrenal gland works, causing problems with heart rate, blood pressure, and other important bodily functions. It's a rare kind of cancer, but it's important to know about it so you can get help if you have any symptoms."],
    ["Aromatase inhibitor", "Aromatase inhibitor is a drug that blocks the activity of an enzyme called aromatase, which the body uses to make estrogen in the ovaries and other tissues. Blocking aromatase lowers the amount of estrogen made by the body, which may stop the growth of cancer cells that need estrogen to grow. Aromatase inhibitors are used to treat some types of breast cancer or to keep it from coming back. They may also be used to help prevent breast cancer in some women who are at a high risk of developing it. Examples of aromatase inhibitors are anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane. Aromatase inhibitors are a type of hormone therapy. Also called AI drug.", "Aromatase inhibitors are drugs that stop the body from making estrogen in certain areas, such as the ovaries.

Low-grade cancer cells look more like normal cells and tend to grow and spread more slowly than high-grade cancer cells. Grading systems are different for each type of cancer. They are used to help plan treatment and determine prognosis. Also called histologic grade and tumor grade.", "Grade refers to the appearance of cancer cells and tissue under a microscope. It's like comparing apples and oranges. Low-grade cancer cells look more like regular cells and grow slower, while high-grade cancer cells look very different from regular cells and grow faster. This helps doctors decide how to treat the cancer and predict how it might behave."],
    ["BRAF gene", "BRAF gene is a gene that makes a protein that is involved in sending signals in cells and in cell growth. Mutated (changed) forms of the BRAF gene and protein have been found in many types of cancer. These changes can increase the growth and spread of cancer cells.", "The BRAF gene is like a messenger inside our cells that helps them grow and divide properly. When this gene gets changed, it can cause problems for the cells and make them grow out of control, which can lead to cancer."],
    ["CAR T-cell therapy", "CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack cancer cells. T cells are taken from a patient’s blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient’s cancer cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. The special receptor is called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. CAR T-cell therapy is used to treat certain blood cancers, and it is being studied in the treatment of other types of cancer. Also called chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy.", "CAR T-cell therapy is a way doctors can use your own body's immune system to fight cancer. They take some of your T cells, which are like tiny soldiers in your body that help fight off bad guys like germs and cancer cells. They then change those T cells in a lab so they can find and attack only the cancer cells. Finally, they give those special T cells back to you through an infusion, and they go to work finding and destroying the cancer cells.
