Examples of fertility preservation procedures include sperm banking, egg freezing, in vitro fertilization with embryo freezing, and certain types of surgery for cervical and ovarian cancer.", "Fertility preservation is a way to protect someone's ability to have children before they go through medical treatments that could make them infertile. This can happen if they get radiation therapy or take certain medicines called chemotherapy. There are different methods to do this, like putting sperm or eggs in a special place where they can be used later to try to have a baby. It's important to talk to a doctor about these options before starting medical treatment to make sure you don't lose your ability to have children."],
    ["Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy", "Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy is a type of radionuclide scan used to find carcinoid and other types of tumors. Radioactive octreotide, a drug similar to somatostatin, is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream.

This type of treatment can help avoid damaging healthy cells nearby, which can reduce side effects and make it easier for the cancer to go away."],
    ["Targeted therapy", "Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to target specific molecules that cancer cells need to survive and spread. Targeted therapies work in different ways to treat cancer. Some stop cancer cells from growing by interrupting signals that cause them to grow and divide, stopping signals that help form blood vessels, delivering cell-killing substances to cancer cells, or starving cancer cells of hormones they need to grow. Other targeted therapies help the immune system kill cancer cells or directly cause cancer cell death. Most targeted therapies are either small-molecule drugs or monoclonal antibodies. Also called molecularly targeted therapy.", "Targeted therapy is a special kind of medicine that goes after the bad guys - cancer cells - and doesn't harm healthy cells in the process. It works by finding and attacking the things that make the cancer cells grow and divide, like a superhero fighting evil.

It's like a map that shows where the cancer is located and how far it has spread. Doctors use staging to figure out the best treatment plan for each patient."],
    ["Endocrine therapy", "Endocrine therapy is treatment that adds, blocks, or removes hormones. For certain conditions (such as diabetes or menopause), hormones are given to adjust low hormone levels. Hormones can also cause certain cancers (such as prostate and breast cancer) to grow. To slow or stop the growth of cancer, synthetic hormones or other drugs may be given to block the bodyâ€™s natural hormones, or surgery is used to remove the gland that makes a certain hormone. Also called hormonal therapy, hormone therapy, and hormone treatment.", "Endocrine therapy is when doctors use hormones to help treat certain medical problems. They might add some hormones to make up for ones that are too low, like in cases of diabetes.
